                                make up our society – where we end up with a bland mix.

                                As the English language further establishes itself as an international choice of
                                communication, it begins to overshadow other languages. Education systems compete in
                                content and<br>
                                style, but they are based in English, which means the cultural aspects of other subjects
                                like math and science can be lost.
                                Moreover, the child's brain might be processing the information and having to translate
                                it to a different language.

                                In many countries, including the UAE, English is taught
                                <br>in a manner that displaces other languages and the cultures attached to them. The AIST
                                approach aims to safeguard<br>
                                tradition while development global citizens.

                                the issue by placing the child in a trilingual environment.

                                Children are very open and adaptive to unlimited new languages up to 5 years old, after
                                which they enter a "stabilization" phase. AIST ECC works with children from 18 months

                                to help promote the key language skills they need.
